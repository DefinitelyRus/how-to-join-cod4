## 3. Download ZeroTier
> **Note**: You can skip this step if you already set up ZeroTier when joining the Minecraft server via VPN. Just make sure ZeroTier is running and you're connected to the **miku39** network.

Please follow the instructions from the [Minecraft server's how-to-join](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/THC-MC-Server?tab=readme-ov-file#zerotier-one-faster-connection). You're done once you've reached Step 7.

Optionally, you can test your connection by opening Command Prompt or Powershell and entering this command: `ping 10.242.128.229`

It should output something like this:

If it says "Destination host unreachable", check if you entered the correct IP address and if you're connected to the ZeroTier network in the system tray.
