# How to join Modern Warfare (2007)

## 1. Download the game
> **Note**: Taking this step lets you skip step 3 but your browser or Windows Security may block certain files.

### Method A - Direct Download (Simplest)
Download the game, patches, and mods on [Transfer.it](https://transfer.it/t/6PgKt2xRjZKJ).

Proceed to [step 2](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/how-to-join-cod4/blob/main/README.md#2-download-zerotier) while the game downloads.

&nbsp;

### Method B - Torrenting

#### Step 1.1. Download [qBittorrent](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent-win32/).

> **Note**: You can skip this step if you already have a torrenting software like Bittorrent or uTorrent.

&nbsp;

#### Step 1.4. Paste the magnet link below and click **Download**.

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:F3AE0F21B09A640174867B1A7AA8BBAEC405032C&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fbt3.t-ru.org%2Fann%3Fmagnet&dn=%5BCD%5D%20Call%20of%20Duty%204%3A%20Modern%20Warfare%20%5BL%5D%20%5BENG%20%2F%20ENG%5D%20(2007%2C%20FPS)%20(1.0)%20%5BActivision%5D

The game should begin downloading immediately. It is done once the status says "Seeding" or "Finished".

Proceed to [step 2](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/how-to-join-cod4/blob/main/README.md#2-download-zerotier) while the game downloads.

&nbsp;

## 2. Download ZeroTier
> **Note**: You can skip this step if you already set up ZeroTier when joining the Minecraft server via VPN. Just make sure ZeroTier is running and you're connected to the **miku39** network.

Please follow the instructions from the [Minecraft server's how-to-join](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/THC-MC-Server?tab=readme-ov-file#zerotier-one-faster-connection). You're done once you've reached Step 7.

Optionally, you can test your connection by opening Command Prompt or Powershell and entering this command: `ping 10.242.128.229`

It should output something like this:

<img width="403" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73ba9f24-1cdd-44d3-8e85-4af08af3743d" />

> **Important**: `10.242.128.229` will NOT be the IP address used in-game.

&nbsp;

If it says "Destination host unreachable", check if you entered the correct IP address and if you're connected to the ZeroTier network in the system tray.

&nbsp;

## 3. Download the multiplayer patches and mods
> Note: If you downloaded the game via Transfer.it, you may skip this step entirely as these files have already been included in the downloaded file.

### Method A - Direct Download (Simplest)
Download the patches and mods on [Transfer.it](https://transfer.it/t/8hK2FqwBjJjK).

Extract "COD4 - PATCHES & MODS.zip" once it's done downloading.

**Do NOT yet install any of its contents.**

&nbsp;

### Method B - Official Sources
Alternatively, you can download them from their official sources:
- [COD4 v1.0-1.6 Patch](https://www.moddb.com/games/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/downloads/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-v16-patch)
- [COD4 v1.6-v1.7 Patch](https://www.moddb.com/games/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/downloads/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-v17-patch)
- [COD4X Mod](https://cod4x.ovh/)
- [Promod + Bot Warfare](https://www.moddb.com/mods/promod-bot-warfare/downloads/promod-bot-warfare)
  - Extract "Promod_Bot_Warfare.1.rar".

**Do NOT yet install any of these files.**

&nbsp;

## 5. Install the game
### 5.1A. Find the game download and extract it (Transfer.it)
> Note: Go to [step 5.1B](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/how-to-join-cod4/blob/main/README.md#51b-find-the-game-download-folder-qbittorrent) if you downloaded the game via qBittorrent.

Go to your browser's downloads folder and extract "COD4 - COMPLETE.zip".

&nbsp;

Go to [step 5.2](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/how-to-join-cod4/blob/main/README.md#52-mount-the-iso).

&nbsp;

### 5.1B. Find the game download folder (qBittorrent)
> Note: Go to [step 5.1A](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/how-to-join-cod4/blob/main/README.md#51a-find-the-game-download-and-extract-it-transferit) if you downloaded the game via Transfer.it.

Open qBittorrent, right-click on "[CD] Call of Duty 4...", and click "Open Destination Folder".

&nbsp;

Go to [step 5.2](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/how-to-join-cod4/blob/main/README.md#52-mount-the-iso).

&nbsp;

### 5.2. Mount the ISO
Look for "Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare.iso", right-click on it, then click "Mount".

> Note: If you downloaded the game via Transfer.it, the ISO is in the "Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare" folder.

This will mount the file as a virtual disk on your computer.

&nbsp;

### 5.3. Install the game
Go to the mounted drive (may be named "DVD Drive (D:) COD4MW").

Look for "setup.exe" and run it.

When it asks you for a product key, enter this: `SJLE-UGY4-QTJD-GYMS-FFA1`

The installer will ask if you want to install DirectX and Visual C++ -- skip them **unless** you've only recently installed Windows on your computer.

&nbsp;


## 6. Install the patches and mods
### 6.1. Singleplayer patch
Go back to your downloads folder where you found "Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare.iso".

Look for a file named "iw3sp.exe" and copy it.

Go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty 4` and paste the file. Click yes on all prompts.

&nbsp;

### 6.2. Multiplayer patches
Go back to your downloads folder.

Look for these files, then install them in **this exact order**:
1. CoD4MW-1.6-PatchSetup.exe
2. CoD4MW-1.6-1.7-PatchSetup.exe
3. CoD4x.21.3.Setup.exe

&nbsp;

### 6.3. Multiplayer mods
Look for the "Promod Bot Warfare" folder and copy **all** of its contents.

Go back to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty 4` and paste all the files. Click yes on all prompts.

&nbsp;

## 7. Play the game
Open your start menu and search for "Call of Duty 4".

Open the Multiplayer game.

<img width="354" height="333" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce54bb4b-ff72-41bf-a86c-fbca86e7f0cf" />

&nbsp;

You will be prompted multiple times for various things. Keep opening the game and clicking yes/ok on all prompts until the game starts normally.

&nbsp;

## 8. Join the server
> Note: Obviously, this will only work while the server is online.

Click "Join Game".

On the options above, set the Source to "Local", then click "Refresh List" (not Quick Refresh).

If none shows up, enter this command: `\connect 10.242.124.233`

Pray that it works lmao
