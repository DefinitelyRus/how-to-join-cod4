# How to join Modern Warfare (2007)

## 1. Download the game
> **Note**: Taking this step lets you skip step 3 but your browser or Windows Security may block certain files.

### Method A - Direct Download (Simplest)
Download the game, patches, and mods on [Transfer.it](https://transfer.it/t/6PgKt2xRjZKJ).

Proceed to step 2 while the game downloads.

&nbsp;

### Method B - Torrenting

#### Step 1.1. Download [qBittorrent](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/qbittorrent-win32/).

> **Note**: You can skip this step if you already have a torrenting software like Bittorrent or uTorrent.

&nbsp;

#### Step 1.2. Install the program then open it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Step 1.4. Paste the magnet link below and click **Download**.

    magnet:?xt=urn:btih:F3AE0F21B09A640174867B1A7AA8BBAEC405032C&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fbt3.t-ru.org%2Fann%3Fmagnet&dn=%5BCD%5D%20Call%20of%20Duty%204%3A%20Modern%20Warfare%20%5BL%5D%20%5BENG%20%2F%20ENG%5D%20(2007%2C%20FPS)%20(1.0)%20%5BActivision%5D

The game should begin downloading immediately. It is done once the status says "Seeding" or "Finished".

Proceed to step 2 while the game downloads.

&nbsp;

## 2. Download ZeroTier
> **Note**: You can skip this step if you already set up ZeroTier when joining the Minecraft server via VPN. Just make sure ZeroTier is running and you're connected to the **miku39** network.

Please follow the instructions from the [Minecraft server's how-to-join](https://github.com/DefinitelyRus/THC-MC-Server?tab=readme-ov-file#zerotier-one-faster-connection). You're done once you've reached Step 7.

Optionally, you can test your connection by opening Command Prompt or Powershell and entering this command: `ping 10.242.128.229`

It should output something like this:

&nbsp;

If it says "Destination host unreachable", check if you entered the correct IP address and if you're connected to the ZeroTier network in the system tray.

> **Important**: `10.242.128.229` will NOT be the IP address used in-game.

&nbsp;

## 3. Download the multiplayer patches and mods
> Note: If you followed Method A on Step 1, you may skip this step entirely as these files have already been included in the downloaded file.

### Method A - Direct Download (Simplest)
Download the patches and mods on [Transfer.it](https://transfer.it/t/8hK2FqwBjJjK).

Extract "COD4 - PATCHES & MODS.zip" once it's done downloading.

### Method B - Official Sources
Alternatively, you can download them from their official sources:
- [COD4 v1.0-1.6 Patch](https://www.moddb.com/games/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/downloads/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-v16-patch)
- [COD4 v1.6-v1.7 Patch](https://www.moddb.com/games/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/downloads/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-v17-patch)
- [COD4X Mod](https://cod4x.ovh/)
- [Promod + Bot Warfare](https://www.moddb.com/mods/promod-bot-warfare/downloads/promod-bot-warfare)
  - Extract "Promod_Bot_Warfare.1.rar".

&nbsp;

## 5. Install the game
### 5.1A. Find the game download and extract it (Transfer.it)
> Note: Go to Step 5.1B if you downloaded the game via qBittorrent.

Go to your browser's downloads folder and extract "COD4 - COMPLETE.zip".
